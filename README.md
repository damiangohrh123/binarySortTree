# binarySortTree  
Creating a binary sort tree  

UPDATE:  
-Watched several videos on Binary Trees, traversal, balancing etc.  
-Overall tough but fun project.  
-More confident in using recursion.  
-Tried using classes again. Very nice encapsulation of code. Will try to use classes again.  
-Understood the whole concept of trees and recursion. If asked to code from scratch, will have some troble.  
  
-Don't know how the prettyPrint method works.  
-For balancing of trees, saw some videos of using AVL trees.  
 But ended up using In-order traversal and using the resulted array to create a new balanced tree.  
 Might be a more advanced thing.
