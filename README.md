# binarySortTree
Creating a binary sort tree

UPDATE:
-Watched several videos on Binary Trees, traversal, balancing etc. <br>
-Overall tough but fun project. <br>
-More confident in using recursion. <br>
-Tried using classes again. Very nice encapsulation of code. Will try to use classes again.<br>
-Understood the whole concept of trees and recursion. If asked to code from scratch, will have some troble.<br>
<br>
-Don't know how the prettyPrint method works.<br>
-For balancing of trees, saw some videos of using AVL trees. <br>
 But ended up using In-order traversal and using the resulted array to create a new balanced tree.<br>
 Might be a more advanced thing.<br>
